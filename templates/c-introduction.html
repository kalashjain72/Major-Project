    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.<br><br>
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.<br><br>
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons âˆ’<br>
Easy to learn<br>
Structured language<br>
It produces efficient programs<br>
It can handle low-level activities<br>
It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Facts about C</h1>
    <p>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.<br>
C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.<br>
The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).<br>
The UNIX OS was totally written in C.<br>
Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.<br>
Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Applications of C Programming</h1>
    <p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are -

  <h1>C Programs</h1>
  <p>
    A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written into one or more text files with extension ".c"; for example, hello.c.
